# Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0: A Powerful Tool for Database Applications
 
Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 is a commercial, proprietary, fourth-generation programming language (4GL) and integrated development environment (IDE) from SoftVelocity that is used to create database applications for Windows[^5^]. Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 supports various data access methods, such as indexed sequential access method (ISAM), structured query language (SQL), and ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and can read and write several flat file and relational database formats[^5^]. Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 also allows developers to output their applications to HTML, XML, plain text, and portable document format (PDF), among others[^5^].

One of the main features of Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 is its code generation facility, which uses a system of templates to describe the program at an abstract level higher than code statements. The generator then turns this higher level into code, which is then compiled and linked using a normal compiler and linker. This generation layer is sometimes referred to as 4GL programming[^5^]. Using the generation layer is optional, as developers can also create programs fully at the code level (the so-called 3 Lager), bypassing all code generation facilities[^5^]. Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 also supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it very flexible[^5^] [^6^].
 
Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 was released in May 1998, with the final 5.0B release in June 1999[^5^]. The product was split into Professional and Enterprise editions, with the latter offering more features and capabilities[^5^]. Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 was followed by Clarion 5.5 in August 2000, which added interfaces to object-oriented programming[^5^]. Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 is still used by many developers around the world, who benefit from its speed, reliability, and productivity[^6^].

Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 has been used by many developers to create various types of database applications for different industries and purposes. Some examples of applications built with Clarion Enterprise Edition 6.0 are:
 
- Whitemarsh Information Systems: A company that provides data management solutions and services, such as data modeling, database design, data integration, and data governance[^1^].
