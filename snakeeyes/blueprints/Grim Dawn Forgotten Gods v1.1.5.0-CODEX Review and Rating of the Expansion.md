Grim Dawn Forgotten Gods v1.1.5.0-CODEX is not only a great expansion, but also a challenging one. You will need to master your skills, gear, and build to survive the dangers of the Korvan Basin and the Shattered Realm. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started:

- Choose your class mastery wisely: The Oathkeeper is a new mastery that specializes in shield and retaliation damage, as well as divine powers. It can be a great choice for tanky and defensive builds, but it also has some offensive potential with skills like Eye of Reckoning and Judgment. You can combine it with any of the other masteries to create different playstyles and synergies.
- Use rune augments to enhance your mobility: Rune augments are a new type of enchantments that can be applied to your medals. They grant you access to various mobility skills, such as leap, teleport, charge, or blink. These skills can help you escape from danger, close the gap with enemies, or explore the map faster. You can buy rune augments from faction vendors or craft them with blueprints.
- Be careful with your attribute points: Attribute points are the only thing that cannot be refunded in Grim Dawn, so you need to plan ahead and spend them wisely. Generally, you want to invest most of your points into Physique, as it gives you more health, defensive ability, and armor absorption. Cunning and Spirit are mainly used to meet the requirements for weapons and jewelry, so you only need to put enough points to equip them. You can also get attribute points from your masteries, devotions, and items.

Grim Dawn Forgotten Gods v1.1.5.0-CODEX is a rewarding and satisfying expansion that will keep you hooked for hours. It offers a lot of content, variety, and fun for a reasonable price. You can get it now from [here](https://codexreloaded.com/grim-dawn-forgotten-gods-v1-1-5-0-codex-filecrypt/) and enjoy the ultimate Grim Dawn experience.
