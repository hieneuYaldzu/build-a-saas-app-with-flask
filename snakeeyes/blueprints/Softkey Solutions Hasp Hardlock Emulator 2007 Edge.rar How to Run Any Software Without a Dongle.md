# How to use Softkey Solutions Hasp Hardlock Emulator 2007 Edge.rar to bypass dongle protection
 
Dongles are small electronic devices that are used to authorize software applications. They are often attached to the computer's USB port or parallel port and provide a unique identification code that verifies the license of the software. However, dongles have some disadvantages and risks, such as being lost, stolen, damaged or incompatible with newer systems. Therefore, some users may want to use dongle emulators to run their software without the need of a physical dongle.

## The advantages of using a dongle emulator
 
Using a dongle emulator can have some benefits for users who want to run their software without a dongle. Some of the advantages are:

- You can protect your original dongle from damage, loss or theft. Dongles are fragile and expensive devices that can be easily broken or misplaced. By using a dongle emulator, you can keep your dongle in a safe place and use a virtual copy instead.
- You can use your software on multiple computers without moving the dongle. Dongles are usually tied to a specific computer or port and can be inconvenient to switch between different machines. By using a dongle emulator, you can run your software on any computer that has the emulator installed.
- You can use your software on newer systems that may not support your dongle. Dongles may become obsolete or incompatible with newer operating systems or hardware. By using a dongle emulator, you can ensure that your software will work on any system that supports the emulator.

## The disadvantages of using a dongle emulator
 
Using a dongle emulator can also have some drawbacks and risks for users who want to run their software without a dongle. Some of the disadvantages are:

- You may violate the license agreement or the intellectual property rights of the software vendor. Dongles are meant to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of software. By using a dongle emulator, you may be breaking the terms and conditions of the software license or infringing on the copyright of the software vendor.
- You may expose your computer to malware or hacking attacks. Dongle emulators are often created by cracking or reverse engineering the dongle protection. This may involve using questionable software or hardware tools that may contain viruses, spyware, trojans or other malicious code. By using a dongle emulator, you may compromise the security and performance of your computer.
- You may experience lower quality or functionality of your software. Dongle emulators may not be able to fully replicate the features and behavior of the original dongle. This may result in errors, glitches, crashes or reduced performance of your software. By using a dongle emulator, you may not get the best user experience from your software.
