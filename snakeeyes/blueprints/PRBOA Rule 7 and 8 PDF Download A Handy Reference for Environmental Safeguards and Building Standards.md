If you are an architecture student or a professional who wants to take the Board Licensure Examination for Architects (BLEA) in the Philippines, you need to have a copy of Rules 7 and 8 of the 2004 Revised IRR of P.D. No. 1096 â1977 National Building Code of the Philippinesâ (NBCP). These rules cover the classification and general requirements of buildings by use or occupancy, and the light and ventilation requirements for buildings and structures.
 
According to the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), you can download a free copy of Rules 7 and 8 from the latest Publication Section of PRBoA Website at [http://www.architectureboard.ph/](http://www.architectureboard.ph/). You may put tabs for easy browsing and highlights are allowed, but no index cards or written notes on the downloaded version will be allowed[^1^]. You need to bring your downloaded copy on the day of the examination, along with your calculator and other required materials.

Alternatively, you can also find Rules 7 and 8 in PDF format from other online sources, such as Scribd[^2^] or Studocu[^3^]. However, you need to make sure that the version you download is consistent with the one from the PRBoA Website, as there may be some differences or errors in the formatting or content. You also need to check if the online source requires you to sign up or pay a fee to access or download the PDF file.
 
Rules 7 and 8 are important documents that you need to study and understand for the BLEA, as they contain the basic principles and standards for designing safe, functional, and comfortable buildings and structures. By downloading them in PDF format, you can easily access them on your computer or mobile device, print them out if needed, and review them anytime and anywhere.
  
Aside from downloading Rules 7 and 8 in PDF format, you also need to prepare for other aspects of the BLEA, such as the practice management, project management, programming and analysis, project planning and design, project development and documentation, and construction and evaluation divisions. These divisions test your knowledge and skills in areas of architecture related to health, safety, and welfare.

To help you study for these divisions, you can use various study materials and tools that are available online or offline. Some of the recommended sources are the NCARB Handbook, the Architizer Blog, the ArchDaily Website, and the CollegeDekho Website. These sources provide you with guidelines, sample questions, suggested references, tips, and strategies for taking the BLEA.
 
However, studying for the BLEA is not only about reading books and articles. You also need to practice your skills and apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios. You can do this by joining study groups, taking mock exams, reviewing your work experience, and visiting construction sites. By doing so, you can improve your confidence, time management, problem-solving, and critical thinking abilities.
 
The biggest tip to passing the BLEA is to commit! Make a plan and stick to it. Don't be discouraged if you don't pass â each exam, pass or fail, is the most valuable learning experience you'll have throughout this process. Remember that becoming a licensed architect is a rewarding and fulfilling career that will allow you to create meaningful spaces for people and society.
